# PRD: crypto-tgalert

## Executive Summary

crypto-tgalert is a highly personalized Telegram bot that functions as an intelligent crypto information terminal. It bridges three critical information silos: exchange data (Binance), social media insights (Twitter/X), and on-chain analytics. The bot provides both proactive real-time alerts and on-demand queries, optimized for a single power user who requires low-latency, high-signal information for trading and market analysis.

## Problem Statement

### What problem are we solving?
Advanced crypto traders and analysts currently face information fragmentation across multiple platforms:
- Exchange data scattered across different trading platforms
- Social sentiment from key influencers requires manual Twitter monitoring
- On-chain activity analysis requires separate blockchain explorers
- No unified, real-time alerting system that combines all three data sources

### Why is this important now?
Crypto markets operate 24/7 with extreme volatility. Information latency directly impacts trading opportunities. Current solutions either focus on single data sources or provide generic mass-market alerts with poor signal-to-noise ratios.

## User Stories

### Primary User Persona: Advanced Crypto Trader/Analyst
**Background:** Experienced trader who makes data-driven decisions and requires real-time market intelligence across multiple information layers.

### User Journey: Setting Up Personalized Intelligence

**Story 1: Social Monitoring Setup**
- As a trader, I want to follow specific Twitter accounts of key market influencers
- So that I can receive real-time posts from these accounts directly in Telegram
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - Use `/follow <username>` command to add Twitter accounts
  - Receive immediate notification when followed accounts post
  - Posts should include original content and any media

**Story 2: Price Alert Configuration**
- As a trader, I want to set precise price alerts for specific assets
- So that I can be notified immediately when market conditions meet my criteria
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - Use `/alert btc > 70000` syntax for threshold alerts
  - Support percentage-based alerts for volatility monitoring
  - Receive instant notifications with current price and context

**Story 3: Technical Indicator Monitoring**
- As an analyst, I want advanced technical alerts (moving average crossovers, breakouts)
- So that I can be notified of significant technical pattern developments
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - Support Golden Cross/Death Cross alerts
  - N-day high/low breakout notifications
  - Configurable timeframes and parameters

**Story 4: On-Demand Market Queries**
- As a trader, I want to quickly query current market data without leaving Telegram
- So that I can make informed decisions without switching applications
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - Query Binance real-time prices, volume, open interest
  - Check 24h gainers/losers rankings
  - Access transaction and wallet information via hash/address lookup

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Core Alert System
1. **Twitter/X Integration**
   - Monitor specific user accounts via Twitter API
   - Real-time push notifications for new posts
   - Support for media content (images, videos)
   - Configurable follow/unfollow commands

2. **Price Alert Engine**
   - Threshold-based alerts (greater than, less than)
   - Percentage change alerts within timeframes
   - Support for all Binance trading pairs
   - Immediate notification delivery

3. **Technical Indicator Alerts**
   - Moving average crossover detection
   - Price breakout alerts (N-day highs/lows)
   - Configurable parameters (timeframe, MA periods)
   - Support for multiple concurrent alerts per asset

4. **On-Demand Query System**
   - Binance API integration for real-time data
   - Blockchain explorer integration (Etherscan, BscScan)
   - Transaction hash lookup functionality
   - Wallet address analysis

#### User Interface (Telegram Commands)
1. **Configuration Commands**
   - `/follow <username>` - Add Twitter account to monitoring
   - `/unfollow <username>` - Remove Twitter account
   - `/alert <asset> <condition> <value>` - Set price alerts
   - `/remove_alert <id>` - Delete specific alerts

2. **Query Commands**
   - Market data queries for prices, volume, rankings
   - On-chain data queries for transactions and addresses
   - Alert status and configuration review

3. **System Commands**
   - Help documentation
   - Status and health checks
   - Configuration backup/restore

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Performance
- Alert delivery latency: <5 seconds from trigger event
- Query response time: <2 seconds for cached data, <10 seconds for live API calls
- System uptime: 99.5% availability target

#### Security
- Secure API key storage for all external services
- Rate limiting to prevent API abuse
- User data encryption for stored configurations
- Secure webhook handling for Twitter events

#### Scalability
- Initially optimized for single-user operation
- Architecture should allow future multi-user expansion
- Efficient resource utilization for cost optimization
- Horizontal scaling capability for alert processing

## Success Criteria

### Measurable Outcomes
1. **Latency Metrics**
   - 95% of alerts delivered within 5 seconds of trigger
   - 95% of queries completed within 10 seconds

2. **Reliability Metrics**
   - 99.5% system uptime
   - Zero missed alerts during monitoring periods
   - 100% accuracy in price alert triggers

3. **User Efficiency Metrics**
   - Reduction in manual monitoring time by 80%
   - Consolidation of 3+ separate tools into single interface
   - 100% of relevant market events captured and delivered

### Key Performance Indicators
- Alert accuracy rate (true positives vs false triggers)
- Response time distribution across different data sources
- User engagement with different alert types
- System resource utilization efficiency

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- Dependent on third-party API reliability (Twitter, Binance, blockchain explorers)
- Rate limiting from external APIs may affect real-time performance
- Telegram Bot API limitations for message formatting and frequency

### Resource Constraints
- Single-user optimization prioritizes cost efficiency over scalability
- Limited budget for premium API access tiers
- Single-developer maintenance and support

### Timeline Constraints
- Personal project with flexible but focused development timeline
- Priority on core alerting functionality over advanced features

## Out of Scope

### Explicitly NOT Building
1. **Multi-user support** - Initial release is single-user focused
2. **Web interface** - All interactions via Telegram commands only
3. **Historical data analysis** - Focus on real-time data only
4. **Portfolio tracking** - Not a portfolio management tool
5. **Trading execution** - Information only, no trading functionality
6. **Group/channel broadcasting** - Private chat only
7. **Periodic summaries** - Real-time alerts only, no digest features
8. **Mobile app** - Telegram integration provides mobile access
