# PRD: Caching-System

## Executive Summary

The Caching-System provides a multi-tier, intelligent caching infrastructure for the crypto-tgalert application, dramatically reducing API calls to Binance while enabling advanced features like comprehensive OI analysis and real-time market monitoring. This system implements memory and persistent caching layers with intelligent TTL strategies, reducing response times by 60-80% and enabling features previously impossible due to API rate limiting.

## Problem Statement

**Current Critical Issues:**
- **API Rate Limiting Bottleneck**: Binance API limits prevent comprehensive market analysis (OI1h limited to 50 symbols vs 300+ available)
- **Performance Degradation**: Commands take 2-5 seconds due to synchronous API calls
- **Resource Waste**: Duplicate API calls when multiple users query same data simultaneously  
- **Feature Limitations**: Advanced analytics impossible due to API call constraints
- **System Fragility**: API failures cause complete feature breakdown

**Why Critical Now:**
- User-alerts system increases API call frequency significantly
- OI1h feature is severely limited and disappointing to users
- System scalability blocked by external API dependencies
- Competition requires faster response times and more comprehensive data

**Business Impact:**
- Poor user experience with slow command responses
- Limited feature differentiation due to API constraints
- Potential service disruption during high usage periods
- Development velocity slowed by API limitations

## User Stories

### Primary Personas

**Power Trader (Advanced User)**
- **Needs**: Comprehensive market analysis with minimal latency
- **Current Pain**: OI1h only shows 50 symbols, missing key opportunities  
- **Goal**: Access all 300+ trading pairs with sub-second response times

**Casual Trader (Regular User)**
- **Needs**: Quick price checks and basic market data
- **Current Pain**: 3-5 second wait times for simple price queries
- **Goal**: Instant responses for common queries

**System Administrator (Internal)**
- **Needs**: Reliable system performance and monitoring
- **Current Pain**: API failures cause complete feature outages
- **Goal**: Resilient system with graceful degradation

### Detailed User Journeys

**Journey 1: Comprehensive OI Analysis**
1. User requests `/oi1h` command
2. System checks multi-symbol cache (300+ symbols)
3. If cache hit (>90% expected): Return results in <1 second
4. If cache miss: Batch fetch missing data, cache for future use
5. User receives complete market analysis instead of limited 50 symbols

**Journey 2: Rapid Price Queries**
1. User queries `/price btc` 
2. System checks L1 memory cache (30-second TTL)
3. Cache hit: Return price instantly (<200ms response)
4. User can query multiple symbols rapidly without API delays

**Journey 3: Alert System Optimization**
1. PriceMonitorService checks 20 active alerts every 30 seconds
2. System batches unique symbol requests, caches results
3. Subsequent price checks use cached data
4. Reduced API calls from 20 to 2-3 per monitoring cycle

## Requirements

## Constraints & Assumptions

**Technical Constraints:**
- Node.js single-threaded limitations require careful memory management

## Dependencies

**Internal Dependencies:**
- Existing BinanceClient API integration
- Current bot command infrastructure
- Database connection (for persistent cache metadata)
- Logger utility for cache operation tracking

**External Dependencies:**

- Node.js file system APIs for persistent storage
- System memory availability for cache operations

**Development Dependencies:**

## Implementation Architecture

**Cache Layer Design:**
```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌──────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│   Bot Commands   │ -> │   Cache Manager  │ -> │  Binance API   │
│   Price Monitor │    │                  │    │                 │
│   Alert System  │    │  ├─ Memory Cache │    │   (Fallback)    │
└─────────────────┘    │  ├─ File Cache   │    └─────────────────┘
                       │  └─ Stats/Monitor│    
                       └──────────────────┘    
```

**Cache Key Strategy:**
- Price data: `price:BTCUSDT:spot` or `price:BTCUSDT:futures`
- Market stats: `stats24h:BTCUSDT`
- OI data: `oi:BTCUSDT:1h:20250908`
- Funding: `funding:BTCUSDT:current`

**TTL Configuration:**
```typescript
const CACHE_TTL = {
  PRICE: 30 * 1000,      // 30 seconds
  STATS_24H: 5 * 60 * 1000,  // 5 minutes  
  FUNDING: 10 * 60 * 1000,   // 10 minutes
  OI_HIST: 60 * 60 * 1000,   // 1 hour
  SYMBOLS: 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000  // 24 hours
}
```

## Risk Assessment

**High Risk:**
- Memory leaks causing system crashes
- Cache corruption affecting data integrity
- Performance regression during cache misses

**Medium Risk:**
- Disk space exhaustion from persistent cache
- Cache invalidation timing issues
- Integration complexity with existing services

**Low Risk:**
- Minor performance variations
- Cache statistics accuracy
- Non-critical feature interactions

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Comprehensive memory monitoring and limits
- Cache validation and integrity checks
- Gradual rollout with fallback mechanisms
- Extensive testing of edge cases and failures

## Success Validation Plan

**Phase 1 Testing:**
- Unit tests for cache operations
- Performance benchmarks vs direct API calls
- Memory usage monitoring under load

**Phase 2 Integration:**
- End-to-end command response time testing
- OI1h comprehensive symbol testing
- Alert system performance validation

**Phase 3 Production:**
- Real-world cache hit ratio monitoring
- User experience feedback collection
- System resource usage tracking

The caching system will transform the crypto-tgalert application from a simple API proxy into a high-performance market analysis platform, enabling features previously impossible due to external API constraints while dramatically improving user experience.
