# System Patterns

## Architectural Patterns (Planned)

### Event-Driven Architecture
For cryptocurrency alert system:
- **Event Sources:** Price changes, volume spikes, technical indicators
- **Event Processing:** Alert rule evaluation
- **Event Distribution:** Telegram message delivery
- **Event Storage:** Alert history and analytics

### Microservices Pattern
Logical separation of concerns:
- **Alert Service:** Rule processing and trigger detection
- **Notification Service:** Telegram bot and message delivery
- **Data Service:** Cryptocurrency data aggregation
- **User Service:** User management and preferences
- **Config Service:** System configuration management

### Observer Pattern
For real-time monitoring:
- **Subjects:** Cryptocurrency prices, market indicators
- **Observers:** Alert rules, user subscriptions
- **Notifications:** Triggered alerts sent to users

## Data Flow Patterns

### Data Pipeline Architecture
```
External APIs → Data Ingestion → Processing → Alert Engine → Telegram Bot → Users
```

1. **Data Ingestion:** Fetch cryptocurrency data from multiple sources
2. **Data Processing:** Normalize, validate, and enrich data
3. **Alert Engine:** Evaluate user-defined rules against current data
4. **Notification System:** Format and deliver alerts via Telegram
5. **Feedback Loop:** Track delivery status and user interactions

### Caching Strategy
- **L1 Cache:** In-memory for frequently accessed data
- **L2 Cache:** Redis for shared state across instances
- **Cache Invalidation:** Time-based and event-triggered

## Design Patterns (Planned)

### Strategy Pattern
For different alert types:
- **PriceAlert:** Threshold-based price monitoring
- **VolumeAlert:** Trading volume spike detection
- **TechnicalAlert:** Technical indicator triggers
- **NewsAlert:** Sentiment and news-based alerts

### Factory Pattern
For creating alert instances:
- **AlertFactory:** Creates appropriate alert type based on configuration
- **NotificationFactory:** Creates platform-specific notifications

### Command Pattern
For user interactions:
- **BotCommands:** /start, /stop, /add_alert, /remove_alert
- **Undo/Redo:** Alert modification history
- **Queuing:** Command processing queue

## Error Handling Patterns

### Circuit Breaker Pattern
For external API reliability:
- **Closed State:** Normal operation
- **Open State:** Fast failure when service is down
- **Half-Open State:** Testing recovery

### Retry Pattern
For transient failures:
- **Exponential Backoff:** Increasing delays between retries
- **Jitter:** Random delay components to avoid thundering herd
- **Dead Letter Queue:** For permanently failed messages

### Bulkhead Pattern
For resource isolation:
- **Connection Pools:** Separate pools for different services
- **Thread Pools:** Isolated execution contexts
- **Rate Limiting:** Per-user and per-service limits

## CCPM Integration Patterns

### Agent-Based Task Management
- **Specialized Agents:** Database, API, Bot, Testing agents
- **Parallel Execution:** Multiple agents working simultaneously
- **Context Preservation:** Agent-specific context isolation

### GitHub Issue Management
- **Epic Decomposition:** Large features broken into issues
- **Task Tracking:** Progress updates via issue comments
- **Automated Sync:** Local changes pushed to GitHub

### Spec-Driven Development
- **PRD → Epic → Tasks:** Clear traceability chain
- **Documentation-First:** Specifications before implementation
- **Validation:** All code traces back to requirements

## Monitoring and Observability Patterns

### Structured Logging
- **Correlation IDs:** Track requests across services
- **Contextual Information:** User, alert, timestamp details
- **Log Levels:** Appropriate severity classification

### Metrics Collection
- **Business Metrics:** Alert accuracy, delivery rates
- **System Metrics:** Response times, error rates
- **User Metrics:** Engagement, satisfaction scores

### Health Check Pattern
- **Service Health:** Individual component status
- **Dependency Health:** External service availability
- **Overall System Health:** Aggregate health status
