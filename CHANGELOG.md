## [2.0.3] - 2025-09-09

### 🛠️ Critical Bug Fixes

#### Trigger Alert System
- **Fixed**: False "new symbol" notifications in trigger alert system
  - Root cause: Multiple application instances running simultaneously causing race conditions
  - Solution: Added validation layer to prevent false "new" symbol detection
  - Enhanced debug logging to trace ranking comparison behavior
  - Implemented double-checking mechanism to verify symbols marked as "new"
- **Enhanced**: Trigger alert comparison logic now properly handles concurrent execution
- **Enhanced**: Debug logging for both gainers and funding rates monitoring
- **Verified**: System no longer sends duplicate notifications for identical rankings

#### System Stability
- **Fixed**: Race conditions in database queries for ranking comparisons
- **Enhanced**: Improved error handling for trigger alert monitoring
- **Enhanced**: Better process isolation to prevent concurrent execution issues

### 🔧 Technical Improvements
- **Debug Logging**: Comprehensive comparison tracing in `src/services/triggerAlerts.ts`

## [2.0.2] - 2025-09-08

### 🛠️ Critical System Fixes

#### Memory Management & Stability
- **Fixed**: JavaScript heap out of memory crash that was causing the bot to fail
  - Implemented proper cleanup for WebSocket reconnection state
  - Added interval validation in PriceMonitorService cleanup
  - Created RateLimiter.destroy() method for proper lifecycle management
  - Fixed global rate limiters cleanup in application shutdown
  - Resolved test suite memory leaks with proper afterAll() cleanup
- **Enhanced**: Application now runs stably without memory leaks
- **Verified**: All tests pass without "worker process failed to exit gracefully" warnings

#### Price Alert System Restoration
- **Fixed**: Price monitoring system not starting (critical bug)
  - Root cause: `await bot.launch()` was blocking the main thread
  - Price alerts were created but never monitored due to system not starting
  - Solution: Made bot.launch() non-blocking to allow all systems to initialize
- **Restored**: Complete price alert workflow now functional:
  - ✅ Alert creation via `/alert btc > 50000`
  - ✅ Automatic price monitoring every 30 seconds  
  - ✅ Alert triggering when conditions are met
  - ✅ Telegram notifications sent successfully
  - ✅ Automatic alert deactivation after triggering
- **Enhanced**: Full startup sequence now completes properly with all systems online

#### Command Interface Fixes
- **Fixed**: `/alerts` command Telegram Markdown parsing error
  - Issue: Special characters in risk icons conflicted with bold Markdown formatting
  - Solution: Simplified to single asterisk formatting and removed replyWithMarkdown()
  - Result: Alert list now displays correctly without parsing errors

### 🔧 Technical Improvements
- **Application Lifecycle**: Complete startup sequence now works as designed
- **Resource Management**: Comprehensive cleanup mechanisms prevent memory accumulation
- **Error Handling**: Better error isolation prevents system-wide failures
- **System Monitoring**: All subsystems (Telegram, Binance, Monitoring, Social) start properly

### 📊 System Status
- **All Core Functions Operational**: Price queries, alerts, monitoring, and notifications
- **Memory Stable**: No memory leaks detected in production or testing
- **Alert System Live**: Successfully detecting and notifying on price conditions
- **API Integration Healthy**: Binance futures data flowing correctly

## [2.0.1] - 2025-01-08

### 🛠️ Critical Bug Fixes
- **Fixed**: Funding rates command showing incomplete data (only 4 symbols instead of all)
  - Switched from `/fapi/v1/fundingRate` (historical data) to `/fapi/v1/premiumIndex` (current rates)
  - Now displays complete funding rates for all active symbols
- **Fixed**: OI1h command displaying incorrect values (1000x smaller due to unit conversion error)
  - Corrected division from 1,000,000,000 to 1,000,000 (millions instead of billions)
- **Enhanced**: Funding rates now normalized to 8-hour equivalent for fair comparison
  - Automatically fetches funding interval data from `/fapi/v1/fundingInfo`
  - Applies formula: `rate_8h = rate_current × (8 / current_interval)`
  - Ensures consistent ranking across symbols with different funding intervals
- **Enhanced**: Risk icons now display in `/price` command for yellowlist tokens
- **Enhanced**: All commands now display risk icons (🚫⛔⚠️) consistently across:
  - `/gainers`, `/losers`, `/funding`, `/oi24h`, `/oi4h`, `/oi1h`, `/price`
